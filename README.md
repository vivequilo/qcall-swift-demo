# QCall Swift ðŸ“±
Swift library for video calls using QÃ¼ilo S.A servers. 

__Install QCall IOS__

With __cocoapods__  **(IOS >= 10)**  <img src="https://cocoapods.org/favicons/favicon.ico" width="30"/>
First add vivequilo specs source at top of your podfile

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/vivequilo/q-specs'
```
then in terminal run
```
pod repo add QCall https://github.com/vivequilo/q-specs
```

Last add the pod the pod to your target application in your podfile
```ruby
target '#TAGET_HERE' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'QCall'
end
```
> **Important!**  You must set bitcode enabled false in build setting for both pod and target using it.


## Example building a room
```swift
    lazy var room: Room = {
        return Room.Builder(deploy: "deploy", key: "key", roomId: "1")
            .setRoomDelegate(delegate: self)
            .setMetadata(json: JSON(["name": "TINTIN"]))
            .setPeerId(id: "IOS")
            .build()
    }()
```
## Example handle local stream event
```swift
	Class ControllerExample: UIViewController, RoomDelegate {
		lazy var localView: QVideoRenderer = {
        	return QVideoRenderer()
    	}()
    	// Add the view
		//All of the delegate functions ...
	    func roomEvent(localPeerId: String, onLocalStream localStream: QMediaStream) {    
	        localView.track = localStream.videoTracks[0]
	    }
	}
```
## Required permissions
Required permissions in Inf.plist
	- Privacy - Camera Usage Description
	- Privacy - Microphone Usage Description

> **Tip:**  You should always use room.close() when finishing the call.

### Functions ðŸ‘¾
Name | Parameters | Description
--- | --- | ---
removeCurrentTrack |  | Removes the current track from the Video renderer

**Properties** ðŸ“¦
Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
renderView | `RTCEAGLVideoView?` | Raw renderer without wrapper View
track | `QVideoTrack?` | Getter of the current video track in the renderer. Setter sets the current track and plays it
mirrored | `Bool` | Value if the view is mirrored or not usefull for front view.

## Client Class
**Properties** ðŸ“¦
Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
id | `String` | String value for the peer id.
metadata | `JSON` | Metadata for the Client class.
call | `MediaConnection?` | Media connection instance of the caller.
conn | `DataConnection?` | Data connection instance of the caller.
stream | `QMediaStream?` | Stream of the caller


## Room Class
> **Tip:**  If you want to reduce the quality go check the QVideoResolutionConstraint.
> To set it you must use the functions **setIdealVideoResolution, setMaxFrameRate...** in the builder.

--- | --- | ---
delegate | `RoomDelegate?` | Room events delegate watches over the events of the room
localClient | `Client` | Local client.
id | `String` | Room id value.
peerId | `String` | Peer id value setted in the builder
metadata | `JSON` | Metadata of the caller.
cameraPosistion | `CameraPosition` | Camera Position of the call. You can changle it by hand or use the mutating function .toggle() .
isMuted | `Boolean` | Value if the muted is muted or not. To mute it you can set value in here.
isHidden | `Boolean` | Value if the current video track is hidden or not. To change it you can set value in here.
localStream | `QMediaStream?` | Getter of the current media stream.
clients | `[Clients]` | Clients in the call array
